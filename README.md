### Phase 3 - Add Bootstrap - [Issue
#3](https://github.com/LARailsLearners/_first_app_instructions/labels/HOMEWORK)

(You could also use Foundation, or some other CSS framework.)    
Bootstrap is a framework that makes it easy for a developer to create a nice
design for a website or web application. There are predefined css classes for
creating common components such as widgets, typography elements, lists, forms,
and more. The framework also provides Javascript which makes it easy to create
things like modals, popovers, scrollspies, accordions, and more. Their
documentation is very thorough, providing example code for most, if not all of
the components that Bootstrap provides.

**Take the time to learn:**
- What Bootstrap gives you. All the layout options that come included are
  awesome and make building functional websites (will buttons, Navbars,
Dropdowns, icons, and labels, etc.) pretty damn good looking and easy it
build. Get a sense of all the Lego pieces that come in the box!
- Understand the logic behind the "grid system" and how it help you organize
  your "views," so the way Bootstrap classes lays things out, makes sense to
you.
